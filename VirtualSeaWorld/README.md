# Virtual Sea World
I love drawing creatures and animals in Aesprite and coding so I decided to combine the two by creating this virtual world that has creatures that each behave differently and interact with each other! You need to download the processing-cor JAR and use an IDE to run this program to see the virtual world but trust me, it's worth it!
